  ## Description
The project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser. The goal of this project is to create a single-page application that allows users to create and save notes or code snippets, with or without an internet connection. The application uses IndexedDB, a client-side storage mechanism, to provide data persistence and redundancy in case the user goes offline.

  ## Features
- Text Editor: The main functionality of the app is to provide a text editor where users can write and edit notes or code snippets. The text editor supports JavaScript syntax highlighting and provides options for line numbers, line wrapping, and indentation.

- IndexedDB Storage: The app uses IndexedDB, a browser-based database, to store and retrieve content created by users. This allows the app to save user data even when the user goes offline.

- PWA Criteria: The app meets the criteria of a Progressive Web Application, including being installable, responsive, and providing a native app-like experience. Users can install the app on their devices and access it from their home screens, just like native mobile apps.

- Service Worker: The app utilizes a service worker to handle offline functionality and caching of static assets. The service worker enables the app to work offline and provide a seamless user experience even when there is no internet connection.

- Web App Manifest: The app includes a Web App Manifest file (manifest.json) that defines metadata and configurations for the PWA. This includes the app's name, short name, description, background color, theme color, and icons for different screen sizes.

- Deployment: The app is set up to be deployed on the Heroku platform using the Heroku Deployment Guide.
